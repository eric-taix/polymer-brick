Why polymer-brick?
-------------

WebComponents and Polymer are really awesome and every developers should have a look to these technologies.  

This project is a POC to demonstrate how to use Polymer to create a WebComponent.  
  
What is polymer-brick?
-----  
Polymer-Briwk is a web component (called a brick) which aims to display a resume of an article:  
  - title  
  - description  
  - image  
  
It also allows to share the article with some social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+).  
**Note:** Sharing buttons are not yet web components but it should...

This component has also many CSS effects which are very cool!

**Disclaimer:** I'm not web designer. Styles of this web component are really inspired by [Slate.fr](http://www.slate.fr)

Hey this is just a web component, so it's really easy ;-)

First import the component

Then  use it  
  
   ```
